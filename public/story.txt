CUTSCENE 1-INTRO

...
This world...
Is broken...
How many years have passed since the fall of civilization
Where once there was light and sound
Exists only the dark and quiet
And fear..
The hubris of humanity has always defined its' destiny
Everyone knew it would one day bring about desctruction
...
And it did

//insert flashbacks scene

We found out that day
That we were never meant to touch the realm of God
Our hands scorched the skies black
Sacrificing our world to the darkness
That had slept so peacefully for so long..


SCENE 3

...
...
will I ever be able to sleep again?
I cant even remember what it feels like

: keep walking
: have a rest
* you sit down on some nearby rubble and take in your surroundings*
Everything seems quiet
...
: check your bag
*inside the bag are a few cans of rations, a blanket, a rope and an old solar powered phone*
...thought I had more food left..

I better keep going
I must be getting closer by now...right?
...
Why did I ever decide to leave..
I never even liked business trips..
...
...
fucking Sydney..

: keep walking
: look for supplies
*you see an abandoned car nearby*
:: approach the car
*you approach the car*
seems alright..
*inside the car are various broken objects*
*You find nothing of value*
Damn..
:: Go around the car

*you continue down the street*
...
...
! ! ...
What was that?

:hide
*you take cover behind some nearby rubble*
:look around
*nothing in sight*

..elp!..
...
*you strain your ears and listen intently*
..
..heeEELLP!
I can hear something!
..someone calling for help? Someone alive..?

:approach
*you start to run towards an intersection*
ROOOOAAAAR
:hide
*you keep listening from behind cover*
ROOOAAAARRR
I can't just stay here! If they're alive, they might be able to help me find Xia'Er!
*you stop hiding and approach the sounds*

Please be in time!
ROOOOAAARRRRR!!
help me! 

*A young woman comes hurtling into view being closely pursued by a towering figure*

: call out to her
*the girl fails to hear you over the noise of crashing behind her*
: keep going


: distract the figure
*you pick up a rock mid-run and hurl it at the figure pursuing the girl*
Take this!
*the rock hits the figure in the head*
RRRRhhh?!
*it turns to you and the girl manages to get some distance*
*You catch up to her in a few paces*
RUN!
: grab her
*You reach out your hand to her, running as hard as you can*
*You manage to grab her wrist*
ROOOAAAARRR!!
*the figure swings out at you*
*you pull her down and duck as the massive arm swoops over your head*
RUN!

*You both hurtle towards the nearest building*

:enter building
*You scramble through a broken doorway into an abandoned 7/11*
*the aisles are covered in dust and filth, as are the shelves*
RRRRAAAAAAA!
*you can hear it approaching*
CRAAASHH!
Come on! He's too big to get through the door!
It won't stop him though!
*her voice sounds familiar...*
*you look stop and look over your shoulder*
*The figure once shrouded in darkness is now illuminated by light reflected off shattered glass*
*what could have once been a man was now a grey lumpen mass of torn skin and flesh*
*it's scalp is covered in pustules and it's mouth a bloody mess*
Look at it's eyes...
*The girl was right, its' eyes were sunken black holes yet in the depths they gleamed with pure malice...and hunger...*
Come on! 
*You grab the girl and keep running into the depths of the building*
:run down the street
*you change course just before entering and swerve to the right, dragging her behind you down the sidewalk*
Why aren't we hiding in there!?
*her voice sounds familiar...*
*The figure fails to stop it's pursuit in time and crashes into the frame of the building entrance*
*glass shatters everywhere and the figure shakes off the debris*
*you look stop and look over your shoulder*
*The figure once shrouded in darkness is now illuminated by light reflected off shattered glass*
*what could have once been a man was now a grey lumpen mass of torn skin and flesh*
*it's scalp is covered in pustules and it's mouth a bloody mess*
Look at it's eyes...
*The girl was right, its' eyes were sunken black holes yet in the depths they gleamed with pure malice...and hunger...*
Come on! 
*You grab the girl and keep running down the street*
